In the previous chapter, we discussed how to create dashboards. While one approach we took was to build a static, serverless web page, another required a server and the client parts of the application. In this chapter, we'll discuss the next logical step: providing programmatic access to your data and/or algorithms, via a RESTful API—similar to the ones we used in [Chapter 9](b8ecbb4e-2220-425e-a65b-0ee129cf2f2f.xhtml), *Shell, Git, Conda, and More – at Your Command*. An API is arguably the most ubiquitous and convenient way of delivering your service; it has few requirements for the consumer (essentially, an internet connection), is easy to publish and distribute, and can be constantly improved upon. Knowing how to build your own API is an essential skill for a developer.

The following topics will be covered in this chapter:

*   What is a RESTful API?
*   Building a basic API service
*   Building a web page
*   Speeding up with asynchronous calls
*   Deploying and testing your API service loads with the Locust package

        

# Technical requirements

In this chapter, we'll use the following libraries:

*   FastAPI
*   `pydantic`
*   `uvicorn`
*   `locust`

Make sure to install them, if you haven't done so already. To test our API, we'll use the `curl` command-line tool. On Windows, you can install `curl` or use the built-in `Invoke-Webrequest` tool, aliased to `wget`. 

Alternatively, you can use Postman, [https://www.getpostman.com](https://www.getpostman.com/), a standalone and free application for testing and exploring web APIs with a nice graphical interface. To install Postman, go to the website and hit Get Started, then select Download. Postman has versions for Windows and Linux. Its interface is quite clean and easy to learn, so we won't cover it here.

All of the code is available in the GitHub repository, in the 

        

# What is a RESTful API?

We worked with APIs before, in [Chapter 9](b8ecbb4e-2220-425e-a65b-0ee129cf2f2f.xhtml), *Shell, Git, Conda, and More – at Your Command*,as clients. So, it would be safe enough to assume we have some idea about an API: it is just an interface that allows us to exchange data with the service. Technically, APIs can use any protocol or means of communication, and there are plenty of applications with all types of interfaces. However, these days, when people say API, they likely mean RESTful API. Here, the **REST** part stands for **Representational State T****ransfer**. REST is based on six guiding architectural principles, but what is more important for us is that it is based around HTTP requests, similar to the ones our browsers execute when we type in a URL.

Behind each RESTful API is a server—or, most likely, a group of servers—ready to execute the command; this command could serve the entire, rich HTML page, or—in the case of an API—some information, either as a binary or some other kind of data structure—the most popular ones are XML and JSON. 

The servers behind each API run a corresponding application. Python is a great language to create such an application! As usual, there is a handful of packages designed to help with the making of APIs. Due to the complexity of the task, these tools tend to be more proactive and involved in the process than your average library, so they are usually called **frameworks**. Indeed, as it is often said, libraries are what you use in your code and frameworks are what you stick your code into. Let's take a look at the assortment of Python web frameworks we can use in the next section.

        

# Python web frameworks

Web frameworks play an important role as the backbone of the web application and an intermediary between the web server and your custom code. Thanks to the web framework, you can write just a handful of functions and classes, and make them accessible for your clients via URLs and web interfaces; all of the internals of routing, protocols, error handling, and security precautions are taken care of by the frameworks. 

Python has a variety of web frameworks for any taste and scale. The most popular are Pyramid, Django, and Flask. Both Pyramid and Django are great options for large and complex applications and incorporate many useful features, including CMS, authentication mechanisms, and many other features, out of the ...

        

# Building a basic API service

A good practice is to start with something simple, where we don't risk having issues in our code—so we can test the framework, first. Let's start with a simple *hello world* application.

Let's dive in and start with a simple hello world-style application that will return the predefined values, with no computations at all:

1.  First, we will need to import the library and initialize the main application object:

```
from fastapi import FastAPI
app = FastAPI()
```

2.  Next, let's define our toy database:

```
db = {'noise': 24,
      'broken hydrant': 2}
```

3.  We now define the function that will be executed for each URL request and return the value:

```
def complaints(complaint_type: str, hour:int) -> dict:
    return {"complaint_type": complaint_type, "hour": hour, "q": db.get(complaint_type, None)}
```

Note that we use type annotations for the arguments. With FastAPI, this is important—those type hints are used for validation and in the autogenerated documentation.

4.  Lastly, we need to register our function as an endpoint for the application, using a decorator:

```
@app.get("/complaints/{complaint_type}")
def complaints(complaint_type: str, hour:int) -> dict:
    return {"complaint_type": complaint_type, "hour": hour, "q": db.get(complaint_type, None)}
```

Note that we specify the type of the request via the `app.get` method (similar to the methods of the requests library) and encode one variable, `complaint_type`, as part of the URL, like an f-string. The framework will take care of the rest.

5.  Now, we can run the server locally:

```
uvicorn hello_world:app --reload
```

By doing so, we trigger `uvicorn` and `ASGI server` to run, serving `app` from the `hello_world.py` file, locally.

6.  Once the application is ready, `uvicorn` will print a line pointing to the correct IP address, similar to this one:

```
INFO: Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

Now, this link itself won't do anything—there is no app served on the root directly.

7.  To test our application, we need to specify a resource, add the path we used in our decorator, and specify the complaint type, as in the following example:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/complaints/noise?hour=12
>>> {"complaint_type":"noise","hour":12, "q":24}
```

8.  Let's check that the application is indeed live—write something clearly wrong as a complaint type, don't pass a value, and see what happens:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/complaints/wrong
>>> {"detail":[{"loc":["query","hour"],"msg":"field required","type":"value_error.missing"}]}

http://127.0.0.1:8000/complaints/wrong?hour=2
>>> {"complaint_type":"wrong","hour":2,"q":null}
```

Let's now discuss what happens under the hood. In our function, we declared two arguments: `complaint_type` and `hour`, each with a specified typing. The former is defined within the route we provide; the latter is not specified there knowing that, FastAPI assumes it will be provided as a parameter. Furthermore, everything in the URL is a string; as FastAPI knows what to expect from the type annotation, it will attempt to parse our values appropriately—note that, in the response, an hour is an integer, and it is not wrapped in quotes.

When we pass an incorrect URL, the first thing that triggered is that there is no hour parameter; therefore, FastAPI raises a scheme validation issue; once an hour is passed, the request is considered successful (except there is no value, of course), as FastAPI does not know which values are acceptable for `complaint_type` (and `hour`, for that matter). So, what happens next?

        

# Exploring service with OpenAPI

Now, don't stop the server just yet; append `/docs` to the given IP address, and you'll open an OpenAPI service:

![](Images/0c3aff37-b081-4a59-a017-5715432ad395.png)

As you can see, it shows the one (and only) API endpoint we have. This page is interactive—you can open the endpoint's tab, write your own parameters (for example, `broken hydrant`), execute the request, and check out the results. As if that isn't enough, there is alternative documentation—to access it, just replace `/docs` with `/redoc`. 

Once this is done, let's move on to finalizing the first iteration.

        

# Finalizing our naive first iteration

Let's imagine we're building a service for the 311 call center. The goal is to estimate the expected time it will take to close the complaint. We will start with a terribly naive model—one that returns a median value for a given type of complaint. As such, it is essentially a pre-computed lookup, similar to the one we used earlier; computing the median is trivial, so we won't cover it. If needed, the code is stored in the repository. As a result, we have a JSON file with a simple key-value structure; for each type of complaint, it stores the median time.

Now, let's modify our existing API to use this data:

1.  First of all, copy the file and call it `311v1.py`. Now, let's create a simple class that resembles a `scikit-learn` model, using lookup data:

```
class naive_model:
    data = None

    def __init__(self, path='./data/model.json'):

        with open(path, 'r') as f:
            self.data = json.load(f)

    def predict(self, type_):
        return self.data.get(type_, None)
```

Why do we make it similar to the `scikit-learn` models? Because that way, it would be easier to swap it with the real one in the future!

2.  Now, we only need to initialize the model on load and replace the hardcoded `hour` value with `expected_time`, predicted by the model:

```
app = FastAPI()
model = naive_model()

@app.get("/complaints/time/{complaint_type}")
def complaints(complaint_type: str):
    return {"complaint_type": complaint_type,
            "expected_time": model.predict(complaint_type)}
```

3.  Again, run it via Uvicorn:

```
uvicorn 311v1:app --reload
```

4.  Specify the type of complaint, as in the following example:

```
$ http://127.0.0.1:8000/complaints/time/noise
{"complaint_type":"water quality","expected_time":19.29}
```

Next, let's see how to validate this data.

        

# Data validation

There is one nasty problem with our current implementation: it is easy to misspell a complaint type—and the API won't let us know of any issue; instead, it will pass it to the model, which will return a null value because it couldn't find a corresponding complaint type.

To make behavior more transparent and easy to work with and to not spend any computations on the invalid requests, we'll need to validate all inputs. In order to do that, let's pre-define the complaint types we have, using the `Enum` library; mixing with `str` allows FastAPI to incorporate it into the schema, as follows:

```
class ComplaintType(str, Enum):    other = "other"    commercial = "commercial"    park = "park"    residential = "residential"    street = "street" vehicle ...
```

        

# Sending data in with POST requests

All of this time, we used the `@app.get` method, which represents the expected HTTP `GET` request. As its name implies, this command is supposed to retrieve information and therefore is designed to store small snippets of data in itself. This data could be passed as `resource`—part of the URL, like `complaint_type` in the preceding example—or appended as a parameter, like `hour` in our first example.

However, there are cases when you need to pass a significant data structure as part of your request. For that, there is another command: `POST`. You see, every request, technically, has three means of passing information:

*   `URL`, which can contain resources and parameters
*   `BODY`, which can store arbitrary data
*   `HEADERS`, a small section for metadata, which describes desired server behavior, and should not be used for API behavior

On top of that, the HTTP specification recommends not to use a body part for `GET` requests, as it goes against the semantics. The bottom line is this: if you need to pass a rich data structure to an API, use the `POST` method and keep this data structure in its body.

Let's imagine that, for some reason, our application now needs to handle the input of new complaints. Every complaint stores multiple pieces of information: location, time, type of complaint, some description, and so on. And of course, there are some rules on what values are acceptable for each data type.

To deal with data structures and validation, FastAPI uses another package: `pydantic`. Let's describe the structure we're expecting as a `pydantic` object. As we'll have to specify the complaint type, we'll reuse the `Enum` object from the preceding example:

```
from pydantic import BaseModel
from datetime import datetime

class Complaint(BaseModel):
    complaint_type:ComplaintType
    timestamp:datetime = datetime.now()
    lat:float
    lon:float
    description:str

@app.post("/input/")
def enter_complaint(body: Complaint):
    return body.dict() # for the sake of simplicity just returns value back

```

Here, we declare a `Complaint` object, which includes the complaint type as `Enum`, and four other parameters. As we wrap our function with a `post` method, a variable not defined in the path is assumed to be the body. We define this parameter to be `Complaint` object, by definition.

        

# Adding features to our service

At this point, our API has two `GET` calls and one `POST` call. The `GET` call estimates the time it will take for each type of complaint to be closed, based on the historic median for each type of call. However, this approach is obviously very naive—it takes into account neither location, time, nor a number of similar complaints in the queue for the same area. To improve our estimate, let's use an ML model, trained to predict a given complaint type, location, and time. You can find all of the details on model training in the `311model.ipynb` notebook. What is important is that the trained model is stored as a Pickle file and expects four features (we collected earlier): type of complaint, latitude, longitude, and time ...

        

# Building a web page

While FastAPI is focused on the APIs, it is still entirely possible to serve HTML pages as well. The code will be almost identical to the preceding code—except that our functions need to return this HTML code.

The most common approach to generate HTML in Python is to use the Jinja2 templating engine—that way, you write the template as an HTML code with some injections of Python and later render them by feeding it with the variables; Jinja will execute and hide the injections, returning the resultant page.

For the sake of building a simple example, however, we will use another package: VDOM, which allows us to generate **VDOMs** (short for **Virtual Document Object Models**) in Python and then convert them into HTML. Flask is great for smaller projects, but not for large and complex applications.

To separate this page from the main API, let's create a separate file, as follows:

1.  Add it to the main application. For that, we'll use routers:

```
# webpage.py
from fastapi import APIRouter
router = APIRouter()
```

2.  Now, we can create a new endpoint, using a router as if it is an app object:

```
@router.get('/dashboard', tags=["dashboard"])
def get_dashboard():
    pass
```

3.  Now, let's generate a very simple VDOM object. To make it a little bit more interesting, let's use some pre-generated images:

```
image_url = "https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/775676979655929856/jn13Vq3D.jpg"
barplot_url = "https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Learn-Python-by-Building-Data-Science-Applications/blob/master/Chapter18/barchart-01.png"
from vdom.helpers import b, div, h1, img, p, span

def dashboard():
    return div(
        span(img(src=image_url, style=dict(width='100', 
                                           heigth='100')), 
             h1('Smart 311 Dashboard')),
        img(width='400', src=barplot_url),
        p('Written in Python, 100%')
    )
```

Here, we use multiple `vdom.helpers` objects. All of them represent corresponding HTML tags and accept class, ID, and all other corresponding attributes, such as `source` for image object, as well as a `style` argument, which expects to receive a dictionary with both keys and values as strings. For now, this object is still a Python object. In a Jupyter Notebook, it can be rendered using the `IPython.display.display` method. For FastAPI, we can convert it into raw HTML, using the `to_html` method.

Now, one obstacle is that, by default, FastAPI converts all returning values into JSON, using the built-in JSON response method of `starlette`, the underlying server FastAPI is built upon. To prevent it from doing that, we can explicitly use another response, one built for serving HTML.

Let's tweak the method we wrote earlier to return the dashboard, wrapped into HTML. Consider the following code for it:

```
from starlette.responses import HTMLResponse

@router.get('/dashboard', tags=["dashboard"])
def get_dashboard():
    content = dashboard().to_html()
    return HTMLResponse(content=content)

```

Lastly, we need to connect our `router` entity back to the main application, so that they can coexist; adding routers is the proper way to add more endpoints to the application without storing them in the same file. Open `311v2.py` and add these two lines:

```
import webpage # here, webpage is the file with the router
app.include_router(webpage.router, prefix='/dashboard')
```

Now, you can check whether the dashboard is loading:

![](Images/42774e6e-e0eb-4548-bd78-3a59993ea60e.png)

Excellent! As we mentioned, FastAPI is focused on APIs and hence has little to offer in the context of web pages, but it still can be used that way. For example, it makes sense to use the same service to support both APIs and some sort of dashboard, if both are required.

Let's now address one more interesting feature FastAPI supports: asynchronous execution.

        

# Speeding up with asynchronous calls

Now, let's turn to the question of performance. Once in a while, our application will need to be constantly monitored and, if needed, scaled and optimized. There are a few ways to speed things up incrementally, for example, by installing the `ujson` package, which works exactly like built-in `json` but is more performant (because it is written in C). In that case, FastAPI will automatically switch to using this library instead.

Potentially, more significant improvement in performance is built into FastAPI, Uvicorn, and based on the new features of Python 3.4 and later versions, *asynchronous calls*. We did spend some time discussing this feature in [Chapter 3](4ee8a15a-87bb-40c8-8c44-9cd7270b0f21.xhtml), *Functions*. In a nutshell, all of the code we generally ...

        

# Deploying and testing your API loads with Locust

Once the application is deployed, but before it is publicly announced or used, it is a good idea to estimate how many requests it can handle. Usually, you can roughly predict the requirements for the service by estimating the number of requests it needs to execute at peak periods, how long those periods are, how fast it should respond, and so on. Once you're clear on the requirements, you'll need to test-load your application.

Test-loads should be performed on the actual, deployed server, not your localhost. Here, we skip over the whole topic of deploying your model. We also didn't use ngnix or any similar gateway servers, which would cache requests, boosting the performance of the API significantly. Deployment of the application deserves a separate book and can be achieved in many ways, depending on your existing infrastructure and resources and the importance of the application. One popular way is to generate a Docker container that can then be pulled and deployed by any cloud infrastructure platform. We will touch on containers in [Chapter 20](d6c1c88b-c429-4bc7-873a-2d91334a2689.xhtml), *Best Practices and Python Performance*.

To run a test-load, Locust requires a simple Python script, which they call a locustfile. Let's see how to use it:

1.  The following code is the file we wrote for our 311 API:

```
from locust import HttpLocust, TaskSet, task

class WebsiteTasks(TaskSet):

    @task
    def preduct(self):
        self.client.get("/predict/residential?latitude=40.675719430504&longitude=-73.860535138411&created_date=2019-06-14T00%3A02%3A11.000")

    @task
    def preduct_async(self):
        self.client.get("/predict_async/residential?latitude=40.675719430504&longitude=-73.860535138411&created_date=2019-06-14T00%3A02%3A11.000")

    @task
    def dashboard(self):
        self.client.get("/dashboard/dashboard")

class WebsiteUser(HttpLocust):

    task_set = WebsiteTasks
    min_wait = 5000
    max_wait = 15000
```

Here, we target two prediction endpoints and a dashboard, keeping all of the parameters the same.

2.  For more rigorous testing, it would be a good idea to generate random request parameters each time, but for now, let's keep it simple. Having the file, let's fire up `locust`:

```
locust --host=http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

3.  Now, head to `http://127.0.0.1:8089`.
4.  In the Locust initial form, specify the desired number of users and growth (other parameters could be set in `locustfile.py`) to simulate and hit Run. For the following screenshot, we set 5,000 users maximum, with a growth of 10 per second.

5.  Once the simulation is started, you can monitor the resultant performance, as well as failures and thrown exceptions, in real time, via the Locust dashboard:

![](Images/2796203c-77eb-44dc-8896-e541fa835bd9.png)

Upon running, Locust will offer you a plan of attack: how many users and at which rate of growth to emulate. Once values are defined, it will start loading the traffic and will show you the results in real time. It's now up to you to monitor and analyze the result, and give a final verdict: did your application pass the test?

Building a web endpoint is an exciting phase of the work. Indeed, you're making your work available for the world to use. Do not rush, skipping the testing part! Making sure your application is written effectively and is fast and up to the traffic loads may save you a lot of time—and nerves—down the road.

        

# Summary

In this chapter, we built our own API and deployed an ML model to send predictions as an endpoint. Using FastAPI's built-in features, we were able to generate interactive documentation and define a schema to validate both inputs and outputs. We further created a simple HTML dashboard, generating charts upon request, and we learned how to tune the performance of the API, leveraging asynchronous functionality. Lastly, we modeled a traffic load on our system, using an open source tool, Locust.

By doing so, we made a fast run over the full cycle of API development: choosing a framework, adding your business logic, and testing. The skills we learned along the way are useful if you want to get the flexibility, scalability, and richness ...
